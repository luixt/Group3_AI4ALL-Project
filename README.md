# Miami Traffic Accidents Severity Predictive Model

## Project Description

### Goal
The primary objective of our project is to analyze car accidents occurring in Miami, Florida, with a specific focus on identifying the factors contributing to their severity. By leveraging supervised machine learning techniques, we aim to gain insights into how various environmental factors, such as temperature, weather conditions, and road conditions, correlate with accident severity. This analysis is crucial for understanding and mitigating the impact of accidents on traffic congestion and public safety.

### Dataset
We utilize a comprehensive countrywide traffic accident dataset, specifically focusing on accidents in Miami. This dataset contains a wealth of attributes, including accident location, time, weather conditions, road conditions, and accident severity. Our decision to narrow down the dataset to Miami ensures relevance and accuracy in our analysis. Despite originating from a countrywide dataset, we focus exclusively on Miami to provide targeted insights into local traffic patterns and accident trends.

### Kaggle Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle. You can find it [**here**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents).

### Methodology
Our methodology encompasses a multi-step process, starting with extensive data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. This includes handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering to extract relevant information. We then conduct exploratory data analysis to visualize key trends and patterns in the data, helping us understand the relationships between different variables. Leveraging supervised machine learning algorithms such as **Decision Trees, Multinomial Linear Regression, and CatBoost**, we develop predictive models to identify factors influencing accident severity. These models are rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure their effectiveness and reliability.
