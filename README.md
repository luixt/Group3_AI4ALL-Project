# Group3_AI4ALL-Project

## Project Description
### Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze car accidents occurring in Miami and identify the factors contributing to their severity. By leveraging a dataset containing information about car accidents, including variables such as location, time, weather conditions, and more, we aim to develop insights into the causes of these crashes. Through the application of supervised machine learning techniques, we seek to understand how various factors such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and other variables correlate with accident severity.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about car accidents that have occurred in Miami. It includes a wide range of attributes such as accident location, time, weather conditions, road conditions, and severity of the accidents. This dataset serves as the foundation for our analysis and model development.

### Methodology
Our approach involves preprocessing and analyzing the dataset to extract meaningful insights. We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the dataset and visualize key trends and patterns. Additionally, we will utilize supervised machine learning algorithms to build predictive models that can identify the factors influencing accident severity.
